# CS50 Week 5 â€“ Inheritance

This repository contains exercises from **CS50 Week 5**, focusing on **Inheritance** in C.

## Overview
Inheritance in C is used to simulate hierarchical relationships between structs using pointers and shared fields. These exercises explore:

- Structs and nested structs
- Function reuse
- Polymorphism-like behavior with C

## Task: Inheritance Exercises

### Description
Implement multiple structs representing a hierarchy (e.g., family generations or employees) and demonstrate:

- Passing structs to functions
- Accessing nested data
- Dynamic memory allocation for multiple levels

### Key Concepts
- Structs and pointers
- Memory allocation (`malloc` / `free`)
- Function parameters and data encapsulation

### Usage
Compile and run with:
```bash
gcc -o inheritance inheritance.c
./inheritance
